A modular system designed to support Axum's design, empowering developers to build scalable, maintainable, and efficient web applications.

**Eyrie** aligns seamlessly with Axum's lightweight and extensible design, providing tools to organize routes, handlers, and state while maintaining Axum's core simplicity. Inspired by the modular architecture and developer-friendly approach of **NestJS**, Eyrie introduces a macro-driven system that simplifies the creation and management of HTTP routers, request handlers, and application state, tailored specifically for the Rust ecosystem.

### Why Eyrie?
- ðŸ›  **Axum-Friendly**: Built to enhance Axum without altering its design principles.
- âœ¨ **Inspired by NestJS**: Modular architecture and tools influenced by NestJS, adapted for Rust's type-safety and performance.
- ðŸš€ **Macro-Driven Development**: Automate and streamline the setup of HTTP routers, handlers, and state using powerful Rust macros.
- ðŸ“¦ **Modular by Nature**: Simplifies application organization with structured modules.
- âš¡ **Seamless Integration**: Works natively with Axum's routing and state management.
- ðŸ’¡ **Developer-Focused**: Reduces boilerplate and promotes clarity for enterprise-scale applications.

With **Eyrie**, you can extend Axum's capabilities while staying true to its design, leveraging ideas inspired by NestJS and the power of Rust macros to build modular, enterprise-ready applications with ease.
